# LinearRegression_Project1

# Project Title :
To predict the Heart Attack Disease for organization WHO (World Health Organization), using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will incresing manner or decreasing manner.

# Problem Statement :
A World Health Organization estimated 12 millions there records. One of them half of the daath result is found in US. The research scholar point out the most relevant risk factor of heart attack. As a Data Science engineering predict the overall risks using machine learning algorithm called as LogisticRegression.

## Task-1 :
import the libraries which is required for prediction.
## Task-2 :
import the dataset using your workspace.
#3 Task-3 :
use a appropriate arguement of sklearn library to train, test and split the dataset.
## Task-4 :
fit your values with arange function using feature scaling.
## Task-5 :
check your model accuracy and precition using confusion matrix.

# Conclusion :
According to the model analysis the LogisticRegression algorithm works successfully with 0.6 accuracy.
The accuracy shows that building the model is successful.
